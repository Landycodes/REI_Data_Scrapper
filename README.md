This is a React fullStack application using React.js, node.js, express, puppeteer.js, Docker and bootstrap.

## About this site
bestplaces.net is a real estate website that gives statistics on cities in the U.S.A such as current population and the average cost of homes. Instead of searching for each city individually and gathering the data needed to find investment opportunities you can use this site to gather as many cities as you want in one search and the app will automatically gather the data for you! All you need to do is enter each city into the input field, seperating each by a new line, and puppeteer will go to bestplaces.net and scrap the data for all the cities you've entered and return a table to you with all the relevant information needed. 

### Caveats
The server i am using from render.com is fairly slow and puppeteer requires a good amount of computing power. So Search queries can take a while to retrieve. This website was built and tested using google chrome so issues may arise when using other browsers. Using chrome to run this app is recommended.
